# Secure Data Hiding in Image Using Steganography

## Description

This project implements a simple **steganography** technique to hide a secret message within an image. The message is embedded by manipulating pixel values (RGB), making it undetectable. The hidden message can only be retrieved using the correct passcode, adding an extra layer of security. This technique is implemented using **Python** and **OpenCV**, providing a basic yet effective method for secure communication.

## Features

- Embed secret messages within image pixels.
- Use of password protection for message decryption.
- Simple Python implementation with OpenCV library.
- Supports text encoding using ASCII values.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for implementing the logic.
- **OpenCV**: Library for reading, editing, and saving images.
- **ASCII Encoding**: Converts text into ASCII values for embedding.
- **Password Protection**: Ensures only authorized access to the hidden message.
